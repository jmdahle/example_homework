## Grading Guidance

### Deployment
* Code is in GitHub and deployed as requested (github pages, Heroku, etc.)
* Provide links to code and deployed application

### Technical Acceptance Criteria
* Confirm you met the stated requirements (pay particular attention to references in the HW to recently-learned material)
* Pay attention to the user stories and acceptance criteria to make sure your application covers all of the expectations

***Examples:***
* Timeblocks are shown from 9 to 5
* Current date at the top of calendar
* Save text associated with any timeblock to localStorage
* Color-coded past, present, future
* Code runs error-free

### Repository Quality
* unique, understandable name for the repo
* organized file structure
* follow naming convention best practices
* use identation and comments in your code; and organize by purpose
* README file should include a screenshot and link to your deployed applicaiton

***Pro Tip***
* Use names that help anyone who is looking at your code, file names, or directories to know what they might find there.  "Homework 5" is less descriptive than, say, "Super Schedule"  This is a really good README are important!


### Application Quality
* UX (user experience) that is intuitive and easy to navigate
* UI (user interface) is polished, clean, and responsive

***UX Tip***
* Give your user feedback!  When they answer a question right or wong, let them know, and give them time to see the message before moving on.

### Academic Integrity
* HW needs to repreent your own work
* If you borrow code, give credit!!
