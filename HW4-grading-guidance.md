## Grading Guidance

### Deployment

* Provide links to code and deployed application

### Technical Acceptance Criteria
* Confirm you met the stated requirements (pay particular attention to references in the HW to recently-learned material)
* Pay attention to the user stories and acceptance criteria to make sure your application covers all of the expectations

***Examples:***
* Timer constantly update
* Extra time is deducted for wrong answers
* There are 2 conditions that end a game
* High scores are maintained in localStorage
* Code runs error-free

### Repository Quality
* file structure
* naming conventions
* identation, organization, comments
* README file should include a screenshot and link to your deployed applicaiton

***Pro Tip***
* Organize your code!  Collect like things together (e.g., all variable references to html page lements are together; all global variables are together; functions are well named so it is easy to understand what they do)


### Application Quality
* UX (user experience) that is intuitive and easy to navigate
* UI (user interface) is polished, clean, and responsive

***UX Tip***
* Give your user feedback!  When they answer a question right or wong, let them know, and give them time to see the message before moving on.

### Academic Integrity
