## Grading Guidance

### Deployment
* Code is in GitHub and deployed as requested (githib pages, Heroku, etc.)
* Provide links to code and deployed application

### Technical Acceptance Criteria

**Examples:**
* deployed application has separate About, Contact, and Portfolio pages
* consistent navigation on each page
* use "semantic" HTML (e.g., article, header, main tags rather than all div)
* use Bootstrap components and grid system

**Pro Tip**
* Use a validator and/or linter to test your code for adherence to standards; exmaple: [W3C HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

### Repository Quality
* file structure
* naming conventions
* identation, organization, comments
* README file

### Application Quality
* Polished result, similar to HW examples

### Academic Integrity
* HW needs to repreent your own work
* If you borrow code, give credit!!
